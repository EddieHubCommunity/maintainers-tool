# Maintainers Tool

## Purpose

This app is designed to help maintainers understand a contributors history with a particular repo.

## Getting Started

This application requires a GitHub Personal Access Token to be set in the .env file.
Directions on generating a PAT are available in the [GitHub Documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens#creating-a-personal-access-token-classic)

First you have to install the dependencies:

```bash
npm ci
```

Than you can run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
